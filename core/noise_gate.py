core/noise_gate.py — keep room noise away from Gemini's speech detector.

THE PROBLEM
    The microphone callback used to forward every block to the server untouched.
    In a quiet room that is fine. In a noisy one (fan, street, cafe, TV) the
    server's voice-activity detection hears a constant din and either decides you
    are still talking (so your turn never ends and it never answers) or cannot
    tell your voice from the background (so it ignores you).

WHAT THIS DOES
    It learns how loud the room is when nobody is speaking, and only lets a block
    through when it is clearly louder than that. While the gate is closed it sends
    DIGITAL SILENCE of the same length, not nothing: the server's end-of-speech
    detector needs to *see* a quiet stretch to know you finished, and a silent
    stream gives it a clean one. A short hang-over keeps the gate open through
    the gaps between words so sentences are not chopped.

HONEST LIMITS
    A level gate separates "louder than the room" from "the room". It cannot
    separate your voice from another person's voice at a similar loudness. For a
    crowded place, a headset mic or push-to-talk (Ctrl+Space) is still the most
    reliable answer; this makes ordinary steady noise stop breaking things.

TUNING (config/api_keys.json)
    "noise_gate": {"enabled": true, "strength": "medium"}
    strength: "mild" | "medium" | "strong" — how far above the room's noise a
    block must be before it counts as you. Raise it if noise still gets through,
    lower it if the start of your sentences is being cut.
